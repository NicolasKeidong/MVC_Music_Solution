# Music
Music is an MVC application to manage musician's information such as personal information, performances, among others. 
On the other hand, the UI was intentionally designed as a minimalistic UI because the purpose of this project was focused on the functionality of the app.

## Installation
- Clone this repository.
- Add your scripts.
- Have fun. :smiley:

## Usage
At the moment, there are no additional steps other than running the application to start using it. This was deployed as a self-contained[^1] app, that's why should not be required any additional packages.

## Additional notes
I'm not planning to continue working on this app, that's why there is no guide on how to collaborate, but if you would like to improve it please do, I'll be happy to help to improve it, thank you.
